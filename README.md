# Model of Biological dynamics base on individuals (C++)
The present model is based on the premise developed by Penna¹, the bit strings, for individuals's aging.

This project is an update of the model developed by Keesen et al². by exploring a new conception of virtual spaces that simulate fragmented areas.

As for the technology used in the development was the C++ programming language, architected with the object-oriented paradigm being the focus of the algorithm the individual.
